# Using CRF for Restoring Casing and Punctuation in Spoken German Transcript

<h3>Introduction-</h3>
<h4>A Conditional Random field is trained to classify data using a set of unigram and bigram features:</h4>
The reults of the training procedure is:<br>
Total Accuracy: 93.70%<br>
Average F1 Score: 80.26%<br>
1. Class 1 - First character is capital F1-score:93.12%<br>
2. Class 2 - First character is capital and token is followed by period F1-score:61.38%<br>
3. Class 3 - First character is capital and token is followed by comma F1-score:68.95%<br>
4. Class 4 - Token is followed by period F1-score:80.32%<br>
5. Class 5 - Token is followed by comma F1-score:80.88%<br>
6. Class 6 - No Change F1-score:96.92%<br>

<h4>Features:</h4>  
1. POS Tags(STTS Tags) : Using [Tree Tagger](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/)
2. Lemma : Using [Tree Tagger](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/)
3. Word Features : Actual Words

<h4>Classifier:</h4>
1. [CRF++](https://taku910.github.io/crfpp/)

Tools: crfpp, numpy
    
<h3>Datasource - Europarl: A Parallel Corpus for Statistical Machine Translation (German Language Version)-</h3>
1. [Europarl Dataset](http://www.statmt.org/europarl/)
2. Traininig Data - train.txt contains first 50,000 lines of Europarl Dataset German version
3. Testing Data - test.txt contains lines 50,001 to 60,000 	
	 
<h3>Programs-</h3>
1. tagger.py - Takes entire corpus as input and generates the Part of Speech tags and the lemma features for each word
2. train_generator.py - Using output from tagger.py and generate train.txt which is in CoNLL format first column are words, second column POS tags, third column Lemma and last column contains output labels 
3. compare.py - Evaluation script to calculate the Accuracy and F1-measure 
4. template.txt - It is the set of features that CRF will use to train the model
5. model_50000lines - It is a binary file generated by CRF++ which will later be used for testing purposes
