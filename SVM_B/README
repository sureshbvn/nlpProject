 Run the script 'new_tagging.py' as the first pre processing step to form the training model for SVM. The following are produced as output:

        save_word_model.txt    output.txt    chunk.txt

   'save_word_model.txt' contains the word vector model trained over 50000 lines of german transcipts in Europarl dataset. The word vector model uses word2vec to train the model.

   'output.txt' contains the intermediary features created for the training dataset.

   'chunk.txt' contains the chunk tags extracted using the German tree tagger.
